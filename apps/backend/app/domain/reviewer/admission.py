"""Admission gate — the single entry point for routing raw coding-agent
findings through the aggregate's filter pipeline.

`aggregate.post_process_raw_findings` already implements the gate logic
(schema → threshold → off-diff → nit cap → cross-file dedup → top-10 cap →
dedup vs prior). `admit_raw_findings` wraps it with the repo lifecycle —
loads the aggregate, runs the gate, saves the survivors — and returns a
structured `AdmissionResult` callers can inspect.

Used by:
- `domain/reviewer/queue.py` (legacy `_run_review_job_inner`) — until the
  queue dismantle replaces it.
- The future `PostFindings` WorkflowCommand body (M05 Phase 4 follow-on
  alongside the queue.py dismantle).

Per the Phase 4 plan item, this consolidates what was previously inline
between `queue.py:769-834` and `aggregate.post_process_raw_findings` into
one place. Callers don't need to know about the repository or the
aggregate's `save()` lifecycle.
